* Wait period

When you display the pop-up for the review typically depends on the product they buy. 
For example, foodies instantly review the foods just after having the items, while the electronics item buyer demands some time for the review. This review plugin for WooCommerce lets you set the time when the pop-up will display to the customer.

Review is important for an e-commerce business and hopefully, you know it. Many customers are more likely to skip giving reviews at the very first attempt. So, you need to display the pop-up again. This Feedback plugin lets you set the time of displaying the pop-up after the first time skip.
